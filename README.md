# PJJWebsite
This is the code to run the website www.phishjustjams.com.  It is written
entirely in JavaScript using the React.JS package for most of the
front-end.  The SoundManager2 package created by Schiller 
(http://schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/) was used to render
the music player.  The majority of the code in 'scipts/page-player.js'
is his, though I made a significant number of changes to get the 
player to work according to my specifications.  All of the code in
'scripts/soundmanager2.js' and 'scripts/soundManagerSetup.js' is his,
and I did not edit it.

The 'scripts/pjj_compiled.js' file is where all of the React.JS code exists
and is entirely my code.  I also make use of the Backbone.JS package.

I used two other packages, one for rendering the pretty dropdown menus,
Boostrap Multiselect, and one for dealing with twitter links.  The source
files for those have been left mostly intact without many of my edits.

All of the css files reside in the 'css/' directory.

'index.html' is of course the main html file used to run everything.
